// patches are for inside changes and bug fixes that are meant to be released
// .dev01 are for new versions that are not meant to be released? no that doesn't work, because
// sometimes dev versions would make minor or even major changes.
//todo but how do I keep the public from recognising more than one version change?
// I don't want them to know "hey I made 10 versions of the UI until I released the next patch
// and went from 1.04.02-stable over 1.05.00-dev to 1.15.04-stable ... (stable=release)
// If I have no API there is no need to document versions, and I can only document with date stamps?
// I don't want my users to think about new versions when they use my app. Except for where changes
// matter and requires the user to learn new stuff! That's the case in games. But you always can
// for example use Youtube without knowing any changes to it. And the web API fields are documented
// separately.

//Todo alright here is the solution:
// do it as in Rimworld: alpha versions leading with 0.
// public string before internal version string: 0.17.1345 - the patch string stays hidden
// public versions are NEVER incrementing the patch code part
// if the internal version was 0.17.1345 and a patch was 0.17.134602 then the next public version
// MUST be labelled 0.17.1347 NOT 0.17.1346 no matter what (!)
// have a different string for the mod-api or only change it with incrementing releases

I want to include date and time. Additionally a little comment string, less than 10 characters.

The API needs to be documented for this system to work.

Additionally github makes a versioning system less important for beginners.

Actually Gradle seems to be best for this purpose.

Still, I should use my own system, and learn to store that little incrementing number myself...


gradle script:
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
        debug{
            //def dateX = new Date().format("dd-MM-yyyy-hh-mm-ss")
            //buildConfigField "String", "buildDateTry", dateX
            def date = new Date()
            def formattedDate = date.format('yyyyMMdd')
            def formattedTime = date.format('HHmm')

            buildConfigField "int", "formattedDate", formattedDate
            buildConfigField "int", "formattedTime", formattedTime
        }
    }

    //1
    task addCurrentDate() {
        // 2
        android.applicationVariants.all { variant ->
            // 3
            variant.outputs.all { output ->
                // 4
                def date = new Date().format("dd-MM-yyyy")
                // 5
                def fileName = variant.name + "_" + date + ".apk"
                // 6
                output.outputFileName = fileName
            }
        }
    }
